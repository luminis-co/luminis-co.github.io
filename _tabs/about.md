## 👋 Hello
I’m a tech enthusiast fascinated by cybersecurity and system administration. I love diving into both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) sides of security, exploring how systems can be strengthened against real-world threats. My passion is to build, protect, and optimize systems, always learning new ways to stay ahead in the constantly evolving world of technology.
